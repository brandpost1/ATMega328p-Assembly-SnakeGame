# ATMega328p-Assembly-SnakeGame
A game I wrote in assembly for the Arduino Uno platform. Not entirely useful without the custom joystick + display, so I have also attached schematics for those just in case. I do not know who made the schematics. But just to clarify, I did not.

Here are some videos demonstrating how it looked during development and also the final version.
